1)
Preallocated  method  is the fastest but you have to know in advance  how many the data frame will have

x <- list()
for (i in 1:10) {
    x[[i]] <- i
}

x <- vector(mode = "list", length = 10)



2)

> data (Boston, package='MASS')
> str(Boston)

> GradeData<-subset(Boston, indus>0)
> df = data.frame(GradeData)
